<!--
This file summarizes key lessons from all retrospectives so Claude Code can
quickly scan institutional knowledge. Updated by the retro workflow.

FORMAT: Each entry includes the project name, date, and the most important
lessons (not all lessons — just the ones worth remembering across projects).
-->

## How This Works

After every retro, the key lessons are added here as a summary entry.
Claude Code reads this file to avoid repeating past mistakes across projects.

## Retros

*No retros yet. This file will be populated after the first project retrospective.*

<!--
EXAMPLE ENTRY (for reference):

### 2026-03 — Claimsforce Tracker
- **Lesson:** Always define all SurrealDB tables in schema.surql before querying.
  v3 throws errors on non-existing tables (unlike v2 which returned empty arrays).
- **Lesson:** Put "ssr: false" in CLAUDE.md constraints, not just nuxt.config.ts.
  Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md first and may not check config files.
- **Pattern:** The adapter pattern (useDatabase + adapters/) worked well for
  dual-target apps. Use it again for any app that needs both web and desktop.
- **Toolkit update:** Added v3 table error handling to surrealdb-v3.md skill.
