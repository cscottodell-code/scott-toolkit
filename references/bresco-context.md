## About Bresco

Bresco is a project co-developed by Scott and Brett. It's separate from Advosy work.

## Key People

| Person | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Scott** | Architecture, specification, quality evaluation |
| **Brett** | Co-developer, vibe coder, less tech knowledge than Scott |

## Project Context for Bresco Work

When building tools for Bresco:
- **Both Scott and Brett** are users/developers
- **Brett** may use the toolkit in the future — keep instructions beginner-friendly
- **Personal/startup feel** is appropriate (less corporate than Advosy)
- Projects live in `~/Sites/` (not `~/Sites/personal/`)
- Brett's n8n instance: https://banc-r.app.n8n.cloud/

## Technical Notes

- Bresco projects use the same tech stack as Advosy (Nuxt 4 + SurrealDB v3 + Tauri 2)
- Brett has less technical knowledge — code should be well-commented
- Prototyping speed matters — get something working and iterate
- No need for Gary handoff (Bresco manages its own deployment)
