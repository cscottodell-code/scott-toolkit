## Project Context for Bresco Work

When building tools for Bresco:
- **Both Scott and Brett** are users/developers
- **Brett** may use the toolkit in the future — keep instructions beginner-friendly
- **Personal/startup feel** is appropriate (less corporate than Advosy)
- Projects live in `~/Sites/bresco/`
- Brett's n8n instance: https://banc-r.app.n8n.cloud/
- No need for Gary handoff — Bresco manages its own deployment

## Technical Notes

- Bresco projects use: Nuxt 4 + SurrealDB v2.6.0 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4
- Brett has less technical knowledge — code should be well-commented
- Prototyping speed matters — get something working and iterate
