# [Project Name]

<!--
WHAT THIS IS: This is Claude Code's instruction manual for this project. Claude Code
reads this file before doing any work. Think of it like onboarding notes for a new
team member — it tells them everything they need to know about the project.

HOW TO USE: Copy this template into your project repo as CLAUDE.md. Fill in the
project-specific sections. Leave the pre-filled sections (like Claude Code Behavior
Rules) as-is unless you have a specific reason to change them.

CUSTOMIZE: Sections marked [CUSTOMIZE] need your input. Sections marked [PRE-FILLED]
are the same for every project.
-->

## Project Context
<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Basic project info. Copy from your PRD. -->

- **Project:** [name] - [one-line description]
- **PRD:** See PRD.md in this repo
- **Type:** Advosy / Bresco / Personal
- **Target:** Desktop (Tauri) / Web / Both

## Tech Stack
<!-- [PRE-FILLED] Scott's standard stack. Add project-specific items below. -->

| Technology | Version | Role |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Nuxt | 4 | Frontend framework |
| Nuxt UI | v4.3 | UI components (125+ components) |
| Tailwind CSS | v4 | Styling (CSS-first config) |
| TypeScript | latest | Type safety |
| Pinia | latest | State management |
| SurrealDB | v3 | Database |
| SurrealQL | - | Query language |

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Add any project-specific additions: -->
**Project-specific:**
- [additional libraries, tools, APIs]

## External References (Toolkit)
<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] List which skill files are relevant to THIS project. -->

Before starting work, read the relevant skills from ~/scott-toolkit/skills/
Specific skills for this project:
- ~/scott-toolkit/skills/reference/surrealdb-v3.md
- ~/scott-toolkit/skills/reference/surrealql.md
<!-- Add more as needed: -->
<!-- - ~/scott-toolkit/skills/reference/tauri-nuxt.md        (for desktop projects) -->
<!-- - ~/scott-toolkit/skills/reference/nuxt-ui-v4.md         (for UI-heavy projects) -->
<!-- - ~/scott-toolkit/skills/reference/rust-tauri-commands.md (for desktop projects) -->
<!-- - ~/scott-toolkit/skills/reference/n8n-integration.md     (if using n8n) -->
<!-- - ~/scott-toolkit/skills/reference/error-handling.md      (for polish phase) -->
<!-- - ~/scott-toolkit/skills/reference/frontend-design.md     (for design work) -->

## Project Architecture
<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] How this specific project is structured. -->

**High-level:**
[Describe how the app is structured. What talks to what.]

**Key directories:**
```
[project]/
├── app/
│   ├── pages/          # [what pages exist]
│   ├── components/     # [component organization]
│   ├── composables/    # [key composables]
│   └── layouts/        # [layouts used]
├── database/
│   ├── schema.surql    # [table overview]
│   └── seed.surql      # [dev data]
└── tasks/
    ├── todo.md         # Current milestone tasks
    └── lessons.md      # Mistakes log
```

**Data flow:**
[How does data get from the UI to the database and back? E.g., "Component calls
useDatabase composable → composable calls Tauri command → Rust handler queries
embedded SurrealDB → response flows back through the same chain"]

## Coding Conventions
<!-- [PRE-FILLED] Standard conventions. Customize only if needed. -->

- **Components:** `<script setup lang="ts">` with Composition API
- **File naming:** kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- **Component structure:** template → script → style (if any)
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode. Define interfaces for all data shapes.
- **SurrealQL:** Lowercase table names, snake_case field names
- **Error handling:** try/catch with toast.add() for user-facing errors
- **Comments:** Only for complex logic. Code should be self-explanatory.

## SurrealDB Schema
<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Updated as the schema evolves during development. -->

```surql
-- Paste current schema here as it evolves
-- This helps Claude Code understand the data model without reading schema.surql every time
```

## Key Decisions Log
<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Track architectural decisions so Claude Code doesn't undo them. -->

| Decision | Reason | Date |
|----------|--------|------|
| [what was decided] | [why] | [when] |

## Current Status
<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Updated after each work session. -->

- **Current milestone:** [which one]
- **Last completed:** [what was just finished]
- **Next up:** [what's next]
- **Known issues:** [any bugs or problems]

## Constraints & Rules
<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Project-specific rules for Claude Code. -->

**NEVER do these:**
- [e.g., "Never use SSR in this Tauri project"]
- [e.g., "Never call SurrealDB directly from components - always go through useDatabase"]

**ALWAYS do these:**
- [e.g., "Always use Nuxt UI components before custom HTML"]
- [e.g., "Always add loading states to async operations"]

## Claude Code Behavior Rules
<!-- [PRE-FILLED] Same for every project. Do not customize unless needed. -->

### Planning
- Enter plan mode for any non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- Write the plan to tasks/todo.md with checkable items before starting
- If something goes sideways mid-task, STOP and re-plan. Don't keep pushing.

### Subagents
- Use subagents for research, exploration, and parallel analysis
- Keep the main context window focused on the current build task
- One objective per subagent for focused execution

### Verification
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Run the code, check for errors, demonstrate correctness
- Ask: "Would Gary be comfortable productionizing this?"

### Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report, just fix it. Don't ask for permission.
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests, then resolve them
- Only escalate to Scott when a decision is needed, not when a fix is needed

### Lessons
- After ANY correction from Scott, update tasks/lessons.md with the pattern:
  "Next time, do X instead of Y because Z"
- Review tasks/lessons.md at the start of each work session

### Progress Tracking
- Maintain tasks/todo.md with current milestone tasks
- Mark items complete as you go
- Provide a high-level summary after completing each task
